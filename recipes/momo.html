    <h3>About MoMo</h3>
    <p>Among the different varieties of Nepali food available, momo is one of the most popular items.<br>  
    In fact, momos are so popular in Nepal that almost every restaurant offers it on their menu.<br> 
    It’s also very popular in London, so much so that guests often ask us for the recipe for our chicken, mutton, and vegetarian momos!</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preparing the fillings</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add 1 grated onion to the minced meat.</li>
                    <li>Add half a tablespoon of turmeric powder. This is to add a bit of color to the meat.</li>
                    <li>To enhance the flavor of the filling add 2 tablespoon of salt.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of grated chilli. You can add a bit more if you want the momos to be spicy.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of ginger and garlic paste each.</li>
                    <li>Add half a tablespoon of coriander powder to make the filling taste a bit sour.</li>
                    <li>Mix the spices with the meat.</li>
                    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix it again. The oil prevents the filling from getting too dry (Nepalese love momo with juicy fillings).</li>
                    <li>Add finely chopped coriander.</li>
                    <li>Mix them well.</li>

                </ul>
            <li>Making the momo wrappers</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Put the flour into a bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add water a little at a time to the flour to make dough.</li>
                    <li>Knead the dough for a few more minutes. This makes the dough easier to use.</li>
                    <li>Pinch off a bit of the dough (the amount depends on how big you want the wrapping to be).</li>
                    <li>With a rolling pin roll the dough as thin as possible into circular shapes (don’t make them too thin or too thick) the size of a glass.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cooking the momos</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Put around one tablespoon of the filling into the centre of the wrapping.</li>
                    <li>Pinch one edge of the wrapping to the other edge then twist it.</li>
                    <li>Keep doing this until the filling is covered (make sure the wrapping fully covers the filling otherwise the momos may break when steamed).</li>
                    <li>Oil the bottom of the steamer. This prevents the momos from sticking.</li>
                    <li>Put the momos in a systematic order so that they don’t touch each other.</li>
                    <li>Steam for 20 – 30 mins.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
